    <!-- 
    Hey guys, it's Jaydar again, back with another stupid project! 
    
    This time, I've made a website that randomizes information every time you reload.
    This is kind of to show off my fancy new knowledge of DOM JS, essentially, it modifies HTML websites in different ways, like making the Khan Academy website respond to your input, or to make something like... This.
    
    I need to add a quick disclaimer that this site is NOT factual in the info it displays, and is NOT SUPPOSED TO BE used for educational purposes. That is because it randomises info every time it loads, so it's very unreliable, obviously.
    
    Anyways, enjoy this interesting experiment I've set up here!
    Sorry, this is kind of a WIP, because I don't quite have much info, just because it took me ~1 hour to comment it, and I don't wanna spend all day on this... yet.

    <h1>The <span class = "lang"></span> language</h1> <!-- The spans with the "lang" class are replaced by 1 random language out of however many, the code itself for replacing the language is later. --->
    <p><span class = "lang"></span> is one of the most spoken languages in the world. It has been spoken by over <span id = "num"></span> million people, beating out <span id = "other-lang"></span> by just <span id = "other-num"></span> million speakers! <!-- The num span is for stating how many million people have supposedly spoken. The other-lang span is for what the lang beat out. And the other-num span is for how many speakers that language beat it out by. ---> <span class =  "lang"></span> is mostly spoken in <span class = "lang-place"></span>.
