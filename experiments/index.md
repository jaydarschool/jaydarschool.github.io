<h1>Jaydar's Experiments: AKA "The Project Graveyard". (WIP)</h1>
  <details>This is where I dump all of my old, bad, broken, unfinished, or abandoned projects, and leave them to rot. I can't really call these experiences or anything like that, rather, they're just... ideas I had one day. You can check out a good amount of them here!</details>
<br>
<h2><a href = "confusing-webpage" target = "_blank">A confusing webpage</a></h2>
<p>This is an interesting one, to be sure.
<br>"A confusing webpage" is an HTML + DOM webpage I worked on sometime around mid-late April, and I haven't worked on it very much since then. However, this is still worth checking out for a little while, as it randomizes a good chunk of the info every time the page is reloaded. I may continue working on this soon, as I feel like the concept itself is very solid and just goofy enough for me. 
<br>Overall, I reccomend checking this one out, as it has a good idea, and it's free to view.</p>
<br>
<h2><a href = "Jaydar's-Calc" target = "_blank">Jaydar's Calculator</a></h2>
<p>"Jaydar's Calculator" is my attempt at a simple calculator using HTML and jQuery (and CSS, to a lesser extent).
<br>If you want more info on it, check out <a href = "https://github.com/jaydarschool/Jaydars-Calculator" target = "_blank">The original GitHub page</a>.</p>
<br>
<h2><a href = "funky-lookin-collection" target = "_blank">The Funky-Lookin COLLECTION!</a></h2>
<p>For those who don't know, funky-lookin stuff is a series of... things? That I made, where you can make, as the name suggests, some funky-lookin stuff.
<br>These projects were originally split across 4 seperate websites on Khan Academy, but I decided to put em all on one page here. I forgot to label them, but the top-left game is the original game, top-right is the sequel, bottom-left is the threequel, and bottom-right is the 4quel/spin-off, hopefully I remember to add labels soon.</p>
