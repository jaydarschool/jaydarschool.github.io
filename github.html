    <h1>Jaydar on GitHub?!</h1>
    <p>As you'd guess, based on the fact that this page is hosted on GitHub Sites, I am on GitHub, for no real reason.
      <br>I have 2 accounts, my <a href = "https://github.com/jaydar10">main account</a>, and my <a href = "https://github.com/jaydarschool">school account</a>, (the account used for this GH Sites page) which I may use at home because I want to work on school projects at home too.
    <br>As well as that, my bigger projects seen on GitHub are posted under the <a href = "https://github.com/Jaydar-Studios">JAYDAR STUDIOS account</a>, however there isn't much there, because I barely have any big projects.</p>
