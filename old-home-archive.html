        <h1 class="headers" id = "main-head"><strong>welcome to my homepage</strong></h1>
        
        <h2 class="headers">this page is stupid</h2>
        
        <h4 class= "headers">it also has all the crap i've made that i'm proud of. 
        <br><strong><em>ALSO QUICK EPILEPSY WARNING FOR ALMOST EVERY GAME ON THIS PAGE!!!</em></strong></h4>

        <h2 class = "Gametitles"><a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/604556847/" target = "_blank">Fake Cookie Clicker: Classic</a></h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "Gameinfo">Fake cookie clicker Classic, my "golden child" when it comes to Scratch programming.
        <br>Truth is, I can't really take credit for this game.
        <br>I programmed the entire game myself, but I need to say:
        <br>I totally took the entire concept of this game from Orteil <em>(hope I spelled your name right)</em>, the creator of real cookie clicker.
        <br>That's really all I had to say, go ahead and enjoy my <em>"beautiful"</em> ripoff of a classic game.
        <br>Also, I'm no longer frequently updating this game, just so I can focus on the next game;
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class = "Gametitles"><a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/fake-cookie-clicker-definitive-edition-v000044/5070418080743424" target = "_blank">Fake Cookie Clicker: Definitive Edition</a></h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "Gameinfo">Fake cookie clicker: Definitive Edition, Classic's younger brother.
        <br>It's pretty early in development, so expect there to be bugs.
        <br>This one is made in JavaScript, yay <em>(for you)</em>. But also AHHHHHHH <em>(for me)</em>.
        <br>That's because it fixes a major bug from Classic, but Definitve Edition is <em>much, much</em> harder to work on.
        <br>Once again, I can't really take credit for this game, blah, blah, blah... credit to Orteil <em>(did I spell it right?)</em>...
        <br>Click the game's title to play it, and <strong>PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ENJOY IT!!!</strong> 
        <br>I've spent way too long working on it!

        <br>
        <p class = "Gameinfo">funky-lookin stuff <em>(yes, that's it's <strong>REAL NAME</strong>,)</em> is a one-off project, but it's  kind of hard to really call it a "game."
        <br>It's more of me just testing the waters when it comes to interactive JS programs.
        <br>The program draws circles that are <em>almost 100%</em> based on your mouse's location (ie color, size, location, ect.)
        <br>You can make some cool-looking... uh... <em>things</em> with this.
        <br>Not to mention that the code is super simple, so funky-lookin stuff can run off of most anything.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class = "Gametitles"><a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/funky-lookin-stuff-2-the-funkying/6496375217897472" target = "_blank">funky-lookin stuff 2: the funkying</a></h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "Gameinfo">Funky-lookin stuff 2 is a sequel to funky-lookin stuff that is more complicated, but not by much.
        <br>It builds off of the idea in its predacessor with it still using lots of parameters from your mouse, but now it has 4 circles that all should have different colors, based on your mouse. 
        <br>It uses a special timer that changes the background color around every 15 seconds.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class = "Gametitles"><a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/funky-lookin-stuff-3-the-threequel/6258403864264704" target = "_blank">funky-lookin stuff 3: the threequel</a></h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "Gameinfo">This is a threequel to funky-lookin stuff, but this time, it uses a lot more random factors to judge aspects about the circles.
        <br>There's still the 15-second background change from funky-lookin stuff 2, though. 
        <br>Mess around for a little while, until you're bored.
        <br><em><strong>B U T Y O U W I L L N E V E R B E B O R E D .</strong></em>

        <br>
        <h2 class = "Gametitles"><a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/598978663/" target = "_blank">Food Game</a></h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "Gameinfo">Food game is about clicking on food, clicking on more food, clicking on even more food, and clicking more food until you get bored and quit.
        <br>Try to go for a high score, and look out for golden food, which gives you tons of points!
        <br>
        <br>Sorry that the gameplay is bland, I made this game in about 20 minutes on a lunch break @ school. 
        <br>I forgot to mention, this is a Scratch game.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class = "Gametitles"><a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/programming-languages-database/4967836622569472" target = "_blank">Programming languages Database</a></h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "Gameinfo">This is not a game, but what the name says it is; a database that shows details on a bunch of programming languages.
        <br>It shows a couple of stats on all of the languages as a whole, and sorts them in a few ways.
        <br>This isn't even close to a game, but it is a thing I've coded, made in SQL.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class = "Gametitles"><a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/622953504/" target = "_blank">DUMB CLICKY GAME</a></h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "Gameinfo" target = "_blank">DUMB CLICKY GAME (Yes, that's it's real name,) is another Scratch game that's much like Food game, in that it is also about clicking things until you get bored.
        <br>This time, instead of food, you're clicking dogs (my scratch account's avatar is a pixel art dog.)
        <br>But there's <strong>ANOTHER TWIST!!!</strong>
        <br>There's tons of dogs on the screen all at once, and they're always moving at random speeds and patterns.
        <br>Also, there's an online highscore system.
        </p>

        <h2 class = "Gametitles"><a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30283988/" target = "_blank">Jaydar1012 OST Season 1</a></h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "Gameinfo">This one isn't a game, or multiple games, or even something like funky-lookin stuff. This is a full-blown OST/Album that was 100% made by me (although I did take inspiration from some other songs on certain tracks, and I did do a mashup once.)
        <br>I know it says "Season 1," but Season 2 only has 1 song in it as of right now.
        <br>Some songs are better than others, but the hope is that this album will make you chuckle, laugh, giggle, or at least make you smile.
        <br>The point of the OST isn't to be good, but to show my personality, and, like I said, to make you laugh.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 class = "Gametitles"><a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/a-confusing-webpage/5930502803472384" target = "_blank">A confusing webpage</a></h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "Gameinfo">This is a webpage, not a game, but it's still worth mentioning, because it's still part of my portfolio of crap. This is, as the name suggests, confusing on purpose.
        <br>It's confusing because it's got text written like an informational essay, but a good portion of this info is randomly generated, and will change every time the webpage is reloaded.
        <br><span class = "disclmr">Just a quick disclaimer; the info on the page isn't actually factual, because, like I said, the info is randomized.</span>

        <br>
        <p class = "Gameinfo">Another non-game thing, but this is to show how well I can code HTML, DOM JS, and CSS, because...
        <br>I MADE A WHOLE FREAKIN' CALCULATOR WITH ALL OF MY KNOWLEDGE!
        <br>Granted, it's very simple, but this still does nearly everything your everyday calculator needs to do.
        <br>It can add, subtract, multiply, and divde 2 numbers. As well as that, you can see the history of solved problems for that session, so that's cool.
        <br><span class = "disclmr">Another disclaimer from jaydar: Just because I made a calculator, it doesn't mean I support or condone cheating in school when it comes to math.</span>
