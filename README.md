Heyo! Jaydar here!
<br>You may be wondering: "What is this supposed to be?"
<br>This is ~~JEOPARDY~~ my new homepage, which is much more professional-looking, however, it has less info on the homepage.
<br>This is why I've archived the original homepage for historic reasons, and because the info on it is still useful.
<br><br>
As it is with most of my projects, this was also made to learn how to use something; GitHub Sites. 
<br>I've been seeing more and more websites and games hosted using GH Sites, so I thought it'd be good to learn how to use it.
